This repository is a forkable and (GitHub Pages) hostable backup attempt of the lucky draw and grouping tool developed by the Education Bureau of Hong Kong SAR Government.

Disclaimer 1: All rights reserved to the Education Bureau of Hong Kong SAR Government.

Disclaimer 2: Original backup credit goes to the author of https://ivantsoi.myds.me. It was the only backup that is open to the public, yet the source files were not open to the public. The hosted original backup can be found at https://ivantsoi.myds.me/web/software_for_htms/GroupingWizard-en-master.

Disclaimer 3: Some functions are not available due to lack of scripts or the tool attempts to call external scripts, such as file import and export for list creation and backup.

Disclaimer 4: Although an attempt of removing calls and refs of obsolete scripts was made, the technology of this tool is still relatively ancient and prone to security vulnerabilities. Proceed with caution when personal data are involved.
